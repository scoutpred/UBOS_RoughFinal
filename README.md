UBOS stands for:
Ultimately Broken Operating System

It's not even an operating system. It's just a simulation of it. For a Filipino word "ubos" meaning empty, it's just an empty brag to show off such a system, but it was a fun creation.

Features the OS-tan of Windows ME, and references WinMe's tendency to...break a lot.

Also trying to impress my instructor on this one back in the day.

I enjoy coding with Visual Basic .NET
